# Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher works by moving the original alphabet by a number amount of spaces for example “A” moved five places would be “F”/ “Apple” would be “Fuuqj” and you can call this encryption. This can be used to communicate to people without them knowing the original message. Decryption is when an Encrypted message is converted back to its original message for example “Fuuqj” would be “Apple”. This is the most effective way to send message which would be difficult for other people to decrypt.
